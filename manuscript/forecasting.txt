# Forecasting

One of the primary theoretic uses of velocity is to determine when the work a team needs to complete can be accomplished.
Whether this is to figure out if a deadline can be met or to set expectations to customers, many teams rely on velocity to make these predictions.
We take the amount of work we believe to be remaining, we divide it by the velocity, multiply it by the length of an iteration, and viola, we have a finish date.
