Use quantitative methods rather than judgmental methods, if enough data exist.
If no data exist, use judgmental methods. But when enough data exist, quantitative methods are expected to be more accurate.
It is not always clear how much data is enough.
This depends on the source, amount, relevance, variability, reliability, and validity of the data.
The research to date offers little guidance. Studies such as the following would be useful; In a laboratory study on the time that groups took to assemble an Erector Set, Bailey and Gupta (1999) compared predictions made by 77 subjects against those from two quantitative learning-curve models.
Bailey and Gupta provided data on the first two, four, six, or eight trials, and made predictions for the next three.
Judgmental predictions were more accurate than quantitative methods given two or four observations.
There was little difference given six observations.
The quantitative approaches were more accurate than judgment when eight observations were available.
