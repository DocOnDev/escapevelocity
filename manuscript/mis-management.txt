## Various Forms of Mismanagement

Herein lies my primary onus for the mantra, "Agile ain't practices".
Agile is a set of values.

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

G> Address the actual problem and use velocity to tell you if you have, in fact, done so.

I see organization after organization pick up practices in the name of agile and
apply them devoid of the values.
Most popular seems to be daily stand-ups and burn-down charts; two tools that
provide project management quick feedback on status so that they can make
informed decisions about items such as task assignment or if the team needs to
put in extra hours to make the deadline.
(By the way, that sentence should make you cringe)

Assigning tasks, driving for excellence in estimating, pushing for points,
treating code as if it is only a means to an end,
role-based incentives, making the team's decisions for them, leaving the team
to make all the decisions (they are self-organizing after all),
splitting people's assignment across teams (they only need 1.5 QA),
burdensome process, and failure to address impediments are but a few examples of
mismanagement.
