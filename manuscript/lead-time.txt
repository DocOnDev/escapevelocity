## Lead Time

In software development Lead Time is generally considered the time elapsed from the moment a request is received to the moment that same request is available in production.
I call this the time from, "Hey, wouldn't it be ice if..?", to, "Hey, ain't that nice?"

For some teams, lead time is measured from when the team starts to look at the request.
In these cases, the timer doesn't start when an item hits the backlog, but rather when the item gets picked up for analysis or whatever is the initial step in the process.
For our purposes, we are going to consider lead time to be from the moment a request arrives in the backlog.

Tracking the complete cycle time allows us to produce better projections for when an item will be complete.
If we know there are 10 items in the backlog ahead of this one and we know that on average an item takes 12 days from backlog arrival to completion, we can reasonably estimate that this one will be done in 120 days.
