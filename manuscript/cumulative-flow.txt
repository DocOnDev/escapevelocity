## Cumulative Flow Diagrams

Cumulative flow diagrams are a simple but very powerful tool used in queuing
theory that help to show the flow of work through a system.
They show the quantity of work in a given state over time, which allows us to
determine lead times, cycles times, Work in Progress, and change in scope.
I've often heard cumulative flow diagrams referred to as an alternative to the
burn up chart, which is an alternative to the burn down chart.
Just as email is an alternative to a printed letter which is an alternative to a
hand written letter when I want to send the same urgent message to 50 people.
All of them get the job done.
One of them is so demonstrably better, the comparison is a bit silly.

The following is a very simple cumulative flow diagram.
This is perhaps a diagram from a team in Lake Wobegon [^Wobegon].
The scope never increases, there is no re-work, and everything flows through
at a smooth even rate.

From left to right, each color area on the chart represents a stage in the team's
flow of work.
Work starts in the form of stories in the ![backlog](images/Backlog Key.png) backlog.
As the team works on a story, the major stages are
![development](images/Development Key.png) development,
![testing](images/Testing Key.png) testing, and
![approval](images/Approval Key.png) business approval.
Once approved, they are deployed into ![production](images/Production Key.png) production.
