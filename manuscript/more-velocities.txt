## Demand for Higher Velocity

This is far and away, the most common Velocity Anti-Pattern, and quite possibly
the most harmful.
It manifests itself in a number of differing fashions, but the basics are the same:
Somebody determines that the team needs to get more done in less time.
This person is usually an authority figure and typically doesn't do the actual
work being asked of the team.

In some cases, the need for higher velocity is based on a set scope for a set date
and some basic (but significantly flawed) math.
Take a team's average velocity and divide it into the total of known work to be
done.
If the number of weeks to complete the work exceed the number of weeks between
now and the deadline, then the team needs to get more done in less time.

In other cases, the need for higher velocity is observed.
The team can be seen loafing.
There are times where nobody is actively writing code.
There are times where more than one individual is working on the same basic
piece of work at a given time.
Not everybody punches in at 8am and out again at 6pm.
Some people don't eat lunch at their desks.
And who knows what people are actually doing when they "work from home?"
This team can clearly move faster - we just need to give them a little push.

And in other cases, the need for higher velocity is borne of expectation.
Everybody knows that when a team goes agile, they get faster.
It's a fact.
It has been written in numerous agile books, especially books on scrum.
Hell, I just wrote it in this book.
It must be true.
And if it is true that teams get faster, all we need to do is help them get there.





Changing points so you can have higher velocity
rewarding teams for increased velocity
story point bloating because more is better.
"you need to increase velocity x% or else miss the deadline"

### Setting Velocity Goals
velocity targets
"you need to increase velocity x% or else miss the deadline"

### Rewards for Velocity
"Every developer must complete at least 13 points per sprint"
"Developers who complete an average of 13 story points will receive a Meets Expectations on their performance review"
"Developers who completes an average of 18 story points will receive a Exceeds Expectations on their performance review"

Hearing from a PM that, after a few iterations, a team "needs to get their velocity up" to ship everything on the planned date.
