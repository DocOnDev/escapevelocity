# About The Title and Cover

"Escape Velocity" is the minimum speed needed for an object to escape from a
massive body [^EscapeVelocity]. Once an object achieves escape velocity, it is
able to free itself from the force of the massive body without any additional
impulse.

I thought this non-risque double entendre was fun.
Not only are we saying a team can "Escape Velocity" as a metric.
But we are saying there is an "Escape Velocity" as which point agile teams can
escape the massive body of Scrum and learn about the broader universe of agile.

The cover image itself is Luna 1, which launched in 1959 and was the first
man-made object to attain escape velocity from Earth.
