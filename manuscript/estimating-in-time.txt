## Estimating in Time

Estimates.
Do we even need them?

To many, this seems a ridiculous question.
You can't plan if you don't have estimates, right?
You can't decide if a project should be started until you know the cost and you
can't know the cost until you know the duration and you can't know the duration
until you estimate how long the steps will take.
It's logical.

So we estimate.

As we want to know how long a thing will take, we are tempted to estimate in
units of time.
As we want to assure that the estimates are as accurate as possible, we are tempted
to estimate in small chunks.
So we commonly take large work efforts, break them down into tasks, and estimate
each task in hours.
We then add the tasks together and, viola, we have an accurate estimate.
Right?

Hours too granular?
Estimate in days.
Not sure what is meant by a day; duration or effort?
Estimate in ideal days - the time it would take if you were able to work at a
consistent pace uninterrupted (because that happens).




Estimates have been a contentious topic for a long time.
There are those that claim that accurately estimating the time it will take to
complete a development task is entirely possible.
For these folks, the ability to provide accurate estimates is a sign of true
professionalism.

There are those that claim that accurately estimating the time it will take to
complete a development task is statistically impossible.
For these folks, claiming one can provide accurate estimates is a sign of a
lack of real-world experience.

Here's a thing you've never done before.
But it's similar to other things you've done.
It's relatively easy to explain and I've provided you pictures of what the
completed item should look like.
I've even described it's desired behavior.
You're a professional, right?
I mean you're at least competent, aren't you?
Then you should have no problem telling me how long it will take you to complete.
By the way, I need your best estimate.
Best being defined as lowest.






Estimates are a funny thing.
Not funny like a good joke, but funny like strange and hard to explain.



I mean, the concept itself is simple.
Given a task to do, say driving to work, take a guess at how long it will take.
You've done this before, right?
So you are making an informed guess; an educated guess.
Now drive to work for a week.
If your drive time is not exactly the same every day, set aside at least an hour
to contemplate why your drive times differed and how you can get better at it
next time.
You're an experienced drive yourself to worker, you should be able to estimate it
accurately.
Try harder.


Using days as points.
tying estimates to time.
If you mean scrum, using hours as points.
