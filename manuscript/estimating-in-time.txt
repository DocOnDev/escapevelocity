## Estimating in Time

There are a number of problems related to estimating in time.
From mistaking effort and duration as equivalent to an obsession with getting estimates "right", estimating in time tends to create too much focus on how long things take versus when things will be done.

If you must estimate, I say, estimate in abstractions.
Abstractions away from time, such as points representing complexity or effort or whatever non-time thing you want to focus on don't necessarily help make estimates any more accurate.
They help by changing our focus and altering our expectations - all through obfuscation.

When we estimate in time, we compare in time.
When we compare in time, we tend to get hung up on the measurement and ignore the statistics.
We often pay more attention to whether or not each item took the time estimated and fail to pay sufficient attention to whether or not the data we've gathered is beneficial for forecasting.

Say you estimate stories in points as a relative measure of complexity.
Over time, you discover that 3 points is approximately 31 hours of work.
The mean is 31, the median is 31, and the mode is 29.
There are obviously some outliers, but our standard deviation is only 3.27 with an entire range of approximately 27 to 35.
We have data that informs us that an estimate of 3 points can usually be completed within a two week period.
Armed with this and similar data on more and less complex stories, we can do a pretty good job of forecasting.

We can map this data on a simple [cycle time control chart](#cycle-time-control-chart).
From there, we can identify outliers and discuss them for learning.
We can hone our precision within a reasonable range, understanding that ultimately, we are taking educated guesses at how complex a task we've never attempted before is going to be.

Estimating in points or some abstraction, we are more willing to accept the durations on face value.
So long as the durations fall within a particular range, we are okay with the variance.
If it turns out that 3 points equates to an average of 31 hours, cool.
If 3 points equate to a duration of 7 days, cool.

When we estimate in time, something awful happens.
Suddenly, the data is supposed to match a pre-determined expectation.
If you say 3 days and the stories take 7 days to complete, we hone in on what we did wrong in estimating.
There is some soft shaming, gnashing of teeth, and a ceremonial 5-why attack on each story that missed the estimate.
"You need to get better at estimating.", becomes a mantra.

But, it turns out that effort and duration are rarely correlated, much less equivalent.
Such correlation only occurs on high process efficiency teams.
For most teams, the correlation is weak or non-existent.
This is due to the fact that most of what impedes the work is queues and system level impediments that are generally unrelated to the work.
For organizations where issues exist such as extensive infrastructure lead times, limited stakeholder availability, or cross-team dependencies, there is almost no correlation of duration to the size of the work.

There are two considerations when it comes to estimating; accuracy and precision.

Accuracy is how close our estimate is to the true value, whereas, precision is how consistent the estimates are.

Let's assume we have a list of completed items and many of those items took 48 working hours to complete.

If we find that our original estimates on these items all fall within the range of 40 to 56, we can say we are pretty accurate.
No estimate is off by more than 20% of the actual.
We are, however, not very precise.
The estimates have a range of 16, which is a pretty big spread relative to the actual work.

If, on the other hand, we find that our original estimates on these items all fall within the range of 32 to 34, we can say we are pretty precise.
All of the estimates are off of the actual by a good amount, but they are within a very tight range.

Of course, in an ideal world, we'd want perfect accuracy (hit the bullseye) and precision (hit it every time).
But if we have to choose between accuracy and precision, precision provides a tighter correlation to actual and allows us to better forecast.
But when we estimate in time, we tend to become focused on accuracy over precision.
