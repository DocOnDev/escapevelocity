# Velocity

Velocity is the speed of something in a particular direction.
In physics, it is the rate at which an object changes its position.
An object that oscillates at a high speed, but always returns to its starting
position has a zero velocity.
In agile software development, velocity is supposed to be the rate at which a
team delivers value to the customer.
A team that completes lots of tasks, but delivers no value should have a zero velocity.

Organization after organization, team after team, I keep seeing the same basic
issues.
Teams everywhere are using velocity as a means of planning their work from a
capacity perspective and are consistently failing.
I'd further argue the majority of those teams who are "successful" in planning
with velocity are actually moving at a pace much slower than they are capable of.
You see, in a great deal of environments, it is more important to be able to
keep commitments than it is to be able to deliver value.
