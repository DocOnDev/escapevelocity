## Feature Use

It seems that one of the hardest things for a software company to do is kill a feature.
We conceived of it, designed it, planned it, created it, tested it, and released it.

Do customers actually use it?

Edge case scenarios that satisfy the needs of an expert user (company owner?) that don't actually serve the needs of the common customer.
