## Feature Use

It seems that one of the hardest things for a software company to do is kill a feature.
We conceived of it, designed it, planned it, created it, tested it, and released it.
How could we possibly kill it?

Yet there are so many pieces of software out there awash with nearly useless features that the majority of users will never utilize.

There is a difference between a product that is loaded with features and a product that is bloated with features.
That difference, as it turns out, is not determined by the creator, but by the consumer.
If they don't use it, it is useless.




Do customers actually use it?

Edge case scenarios that satisfy the needs of an expert user (company owner?) that don't actually serve the needs of the common customer.
