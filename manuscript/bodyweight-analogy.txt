## Velocity by way of analogy

So if we know that velocity is a lagging indicator of a complex system, we can
probably reason about velocity by way of analogy.
There is something we all have in common that is also a lagging indicator of
a complex system - our body weight.
Our body weight is a lagging indicator of a complex system.
There are inputs and outputs and there are multiple factors that impact the
system overall.
From our diet and exercise to genetics and even our social network, there are
numerous factors that impact our body weight.
As we've covered, the same is true for a team's velocity multiple factors impact
a team's velocity.

By body weight alone, can we tell if an individual is healthy?
If I were to tell you our patient's name is Pat and their body weight is 130,
could you tell me definitively if Pat were in good or poor health?
What about a body weight of 100?
What about a body weight of 300?
If Pat is a linebacker for the Detroit Lions, 300 pounds might be a perfectly
healthy body weight.
The answer is, no.
Body weight alone cannot tell you if the individual is healthy.

Moreover, if the body weight were in a range that strongly suggested poor health,
say 600 pounds, you could not ascertain from the body weight what to do for this
individual to help them shed weight in a healthy manner.

The same is true of velocity.
Adding to the challenge is the fact that velocity has no baseline standard.
There is no commonly accepted range within which velocity falls, so our assessment
of health gets even more difficult.
It is common to see a team with a consistent velocity of 100 or more points per
iteration being outperformed by a team with a consistent velocity of 30 points.
Points don't translate from team to team, save basic trending.
More points is more software delivered.
Fewer points is less software delivered.
This is assuming, of course, that you don't point tasks and other non-creation work.
If you do that, you'll likely see little to no correlation between velocity
and delivery of software.

Now wee do know that a velocity of 0 is generally an indication of poor health.
And just like with bodyweight, while we know the patient is in poor health, we
don't have enough data to make an informed recommendation for improvement.
We can say generic things like, "Go on a diet", or, "Focus on getting to done",
but we cannot really provide specific advice with the information we have.
