### Capacity Loading
When we are capacity loading, we see individuals as resources that have a specific capacity.
Given these resources have a cost associated with them, we need maximize their utilization in order to optimize our return on investment.
As a result, every resource on the team is loaded to as close to 100% capacity as possible.

Those that think this way believe that loading a team to full capacity is good management.

It is not good management. In fact, it is bad management.
