# Acknowledgements

There is no possible way I can acknowledge all who've had an impact on me and
made this possible.
So many have touched my life in so many ways.
Herein I will attempt to acknowledge those who've had a direct impact on the
making of this book.
Know that if I haven't mentioned you, you are in my heart and I am sorry for
the oversight.

I love you all. Sincerely.
