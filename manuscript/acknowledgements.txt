# Acknowledgements

I've had the great fortune of working with amazing people my entire career.
There is no possible way I can acknowledge all who've had an impact on me and
made this possible.
So many have touched my life in so many ways.
Herein I will attempt to acknowledge those who've had a direct impact on the
making of this book.
Know that if I haven't mentioned you, you are in my heart and I am sorry for
the oversight.

I love you all. Sincerely.



I started my career at a Law Firm in Cleveland Ohio where *Richard Kucia* and
*Joe Sladick* mentored me as I moved from hobbyist to professional. Joe was
especially influential as it was he who showed me the benefits of working in
small chunks.

I soon started my own consultancy where I eventually partnered with
*Brian Goleno* and *Mike Farona*, both of whom were influential in my
continued growth. It was there that we first started experimenting with
alternative approaches to software and it was Brian who pointed me toward XP
and then ThoughtWorks, a company I followed for years before joining.

At ThoughtWorks, I found a home, albeit temporary.
The number of people with whom I had opportunity to have great discussions and
debate and to learn from is too great to count.
From *Mike Royle* who served as my first official mentor to *Gregg "Hippie" Warren*
who ran with me and gave me a fantastic opportunity and challenge to work on.
I  met, collaborated with, and was influenced by *Doc List*, *Rebecca Parsons*,
*Martin Fowler*, *Amanda Laucher*, *Paul Hammant*, *Patrick Sarnacke*,
*Chris Kozak*, *Pramod Sadalage*, and so many others.

Through the ThoughtWorks network, I had the opportunity to meet and interact with
*Dan North*, *Jezz Humble*, *Liz Keogh*, and *Dave Hoover* all of whom have
influenced and help to shape my thinking.

In leaving ThoughtWorks, I joined LeanDog as a partner.
There I had opportunity to work with *Jeff Morgan* who is one of the most
passionate developers I know and *Jon Stahl* who influenced my knowledge of lean,
systems thinking, and leadership.
Through LeanDog, I met *Corey Haines*, *JB Rainsburger*, *Diane Zajac*,
and *Gary Bernhardt* all of whom blew me away with their passion, knowledge,
contribution, and abilities.

As my exposure to the agile community grew, I had the fortune to meet and spent
quality time with *Diana Larsen*, *Esther Derby*, *Ward Cunningham*, *Bob Martin*,
*Ron Jeffries*, *Chet Hendrickson*, *James Grenning*, *Jon Kern*, and many others.
What I thought I knew was challenged and I turned from being the "expert" to being
a beginner, which I've tried to be ever since.

At Groupon, I had a unique opportunity to take everything I'd learned and put it into practice.
My small team started a movement within Groupon Engineering to put people
above process and to foster Autonomy, Connection, Excellence, and Diversity.
These are the cornerstones of CTO2's philosophy and mission today.

Of course, none of this was possible without the continued support of my family.
*Teri Puskus*, *Richard W. Norton*, *Richard R. Norton*, *Jennifer Norton*,
*Courtney Norton*, and *Sean Norton* made up my greatest support network and gave
me purpose in life.

I am truly blessed.
