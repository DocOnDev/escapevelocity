## Dependencies on Other Teams or Individuals

Perhaps your product owner is not available often enough and there is too much
re-work due to slow feedback cycles.
Maybe you haven't rights to your various environments and code migrations are
executed in durations of days rather than minutes.
It's possible some other technical team is not able to be as responsive or
relies on process more than interactions for the exchange of information.
Whatever it might be, any point where you need to wait for extended periods of
time, is likely to lead to other problems.
You can't sit idle, so you grab another card to work on, leading to too much
work in progress.

Work with these teams and individuals on ways to automate processes or find
other ways to reduce their response time.
Invite sponsors and others to your stand-ups, iteration planning, and
retrospectives.
If they consistently don't show, see if you can get another representative.
Be professional and courteous, but there is no need to be completely deferent.
If the project is important, you should be able to ask for the necessary support.
