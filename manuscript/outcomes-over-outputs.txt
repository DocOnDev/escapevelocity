## Outcomes over Outputs

I've worked with many companies who've conflated delivery of features with delivery of value.
They begin with the assumption that a feature adds value to the customer.
This is often the case, but it is not always so.
Some features are rarely or never used, providing little to no realized value.
Some features are used out of necessity, but actually detract from the customer experience, potentially offering negative realized value.

Output measurements focus on quantity of delivery, such as the count of features delivered.
As a result, output measures tell us how fast we are moving.
Outcome measurements focus on quality of delivery - or more accurately, the impact of delivery, such as how many customers are engaging in a key activity.
As a result, outcome measures tell us if we are headed in the right direction.

Speed (output) is beneficial only if you are headed in the right direction (outcome).
