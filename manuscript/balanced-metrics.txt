# Balanced Metrics

We've discussed a number of possible metrics to augment or even replace velocity.
Rather than looking for the one true measure, it is important that we create a
portfolio of measures that properly inform us about our process and progress.
My advice to teams is to measure many things.
Or, in the words of David J. Bland, "Measure what you want to go up, but also measure
what you don't want to go down."
