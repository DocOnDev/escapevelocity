### Cycle-Time Control Charts

Control charts focus on the cycle time of individual issues - the total time
from "in progress" to "done".
Teams with shorter cycle times are likely to have higher throughput, and teams
with consistent cycle times across many issues are more predictable in delivering work.
While cycle time is a primary metric for kanban teams, scrum teams can benefit
from optimized cycle time as well.

Measuring cycle time is an efficient and flexible way to improve a team's
processes because the results of changes are discernable almost immediately,
allowing them to make any further adjustments right away.
The end goal is to have a consistent and short cycle time, regardless of the
type of work.
