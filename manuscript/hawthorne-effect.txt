## The Hawthorne Effect

Western Electric had commission an extensive study that ran from 1924 to 1932
at their Hawthorne Works in Cicero, IL.
The intent of the study was to determine the impact of ambient lighting on worker productivity.
Would employees be more productive under high levels of light or low levels of light?
The workers in the factory were divided into two groups based on physical location
within the plant.
For one group, the lighting was increased dramatically while for the other group
(the control) lighting levels remained the same.
Researchers found that productivity improved among the group for whom lighting changed
whereas the control group had no statistically significant change.

Employee working conditions were then changed in other ways.
Working hours were adjusted, rest breaks were changed, floors were rearranged,
workstations were kept more cleanly, and several other adjustments including
returning the lighting back to normal levels and changing practices and policies
back to original standards.

With every change, productivity made small improvements.
By early 1932, and the end of the studies, the factory productivity was at an
all time high and employee attendance and retention were at record setting levels.
Some groups seemed to do better than others, but across the factory, all measures
were improved.

When the studies ended, productivity, attendance, and retention soon returned
to original levels.

There are two things we can learn from the Hawthorne studies.

The first is that which gets measured will improve.
"The Hawthorne Effect" is described as the phenomenon in which subjects in
behavioral studies change their performance in response to being observed.

The second is that an employee's working group actually has more impact on their
performance than leadership.
In the end, the study determined that it was not any of the environmental changes
that had the most significant impact on worker improvement, but the working group
to which the employee belonged.
Elton Mayo, the sociologist who ran the experiments once observed,
"The desire to stand well with one's fellows, the so-called human instinct of
association, easily outweighs the merely individual interest and the logic of
reasoning upon which so many spurious principles of management are based."
