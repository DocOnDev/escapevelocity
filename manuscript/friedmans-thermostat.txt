## Friedman's Thermostat
Milton Friedman was an award winning economist who, among other things, served as
advisor to President Ronald Reagan.

In an article published in The Wall Street Journal in August of 2003, Friedman
stated, "The contrast between the periods before and after the middle of the 1980s is remarkable. Before,
it is like a chart of the temperature in a room without a thermostat in a location with very
variable climate; after, it is like the temperature in the same room but with a reasonably good
though not perfect thermostat, and one that is set to a gradually declining temperature. Sometime
around 1985, the Fed appears to have acquired the thermostat that it had been seeking the whole
of its life."

The article continues on to explain that the real cause of the improvement was a
change in the way the Federal Reserve approached their role in regard to price
stability.
Prior to the 1980s, Keynesian Economics, the dominant theory of the times, taught
economists that the volume of money did not matter in the control of price stability
as there was no correlation between volume and price.
But this theory was disproven as shown by performance in the 1970s and 1980s.
New Keynesian Economics now include quantity as part of the theory.

Rather than get any further into the details of economic theory, of which I am
grossly disqualified to do, I thought it better to explain Friedman's Thermostat
with a parable of my own involving a thermostat.


### The case against thermostats
Imagine for a moment, that you are the ruler of a sovereign province.
The people are happy under your rule.
There is plenty of food to go around, everyone has meaningful work that contributes
to the overall health and wellbeing of the people.
There is time for leisure and your people want for very little.
If there were one wish; one thing the people would like, it would be for the winters to be less harsh.
Summers in the land are wonderful with long comfortable days, lush green lands, and blue skies.
Spring and Fall are equally beautiful in their varying colors and the cooler, but comfortable temperatures.
But winter is harshly cold and the days are short.
A mere three months out of twelve, the winters are nearly insufferable.
The nights may be long, but sleep is hard to come by.
Families must take shifts tending to the fire and everyone must huddle together
in the main room to keep warm; man and pet.

One day, you hear of a land three days ride away where the people do not suffer through
the winter.
A land where despite the cold, the homes are warm throughout.
These people have a mysterious device in every household that they call the "thermostat".
These thermostats, small dials on the wall, somehow allow the people of this land to
keep their homes at whatever temperature they desire throughout the winter.

Curious, and hopeful that such a magical device might work in your own homes,
you send a small party to visit the land and to learn about these thermostats.
They are instructed to observe these people and their devices, gather data,
and devise a plan for how your land can best solve the challenge of harsh winters.
The party takes off just as the leaves are starting to turn vibrant; the first
warning of winter's approach.

Weeks pass and the fall turns to winter and the winter grows more bitter,
but you hold faith that the research party will return and provide answers.
As the worst of winter seems to be over, the party returns, riding hard to the
gates.

"We've news, your highness, of the utmost urgency. We've ridden practically straight
through."

You can see they are worn and weary from long days and short nights.

"Have you made adequate observations to understand what is happening?", you ask
to the head of the party, a chief scientist who has taken sabbatical from the
university to make this trip.

"We have.", they answer.

"And", you inquire in anticipation, "do you have a clear plan for how we might ease the bitter winters?"

"We do...", they reply hesitantly.

"Well, waste not another minute!", you exclaim impatiently, "Tell me. What is your plan?"

Calmly, carefully, and crisply, as though to ensure you do not mishear, they state,
"We must go to war with them. We must stop them."

"What?", you inquire, puzzled and thinking that you must have misheard,
"Go to war? Stop them from what? What have you learned?"

A little more rushed this time, accidentally confessing a sense of anxiety, they continue,
"Well, you see, your highness, we observed for many weeks the activities of
these people and their strange devices.
We learned that rather than burning wood, they burn a type of liquid they call fuel.
This fuel is drawn from the ground and distributed to each of the homes.
So we had three things to observe; the inside temperature, the outside temperature,
and the amount of fuel they consumed."

"And what did you find?", you ask, frustrated at how long this is taking; you
would not wage war, risking people's lives, over trivial matters and fuel and
temperature readings are trivial matters,
"How is it that we must wage war to make our homes comfortable in winter?"

"Well, your highness,", they reply, once again calm and measured,
"after careful observation, we determined a few things."

"Again, there were three things to measure; Inside Temperature, Outside Temperature,
and Fuel Consumed."

If rolling your eyes were dignified in the least, you'd do it right now.

"First, your highness, we observed that the temperate in the home remained
comfortable throughout the winter. In fact, the home temperature fluctuated only
slightly. Small enough that the fluctuation falls within a reasonable margin of error.
For all intents and purposes, the temperature of the home remained constant."

"That is the point.", you think to yourself, putting a great deal of effort into being patient.
"Are all scientists this long-winded?"

"Second, we observed that both the outside temperature and the fuel consumption
varied significantly."

"Upon further analysis of the data, we found no correlation between the outside temperature
and the inside temperature of the home. We also found no correlation between the fuel consumption
and the temperature in the home. No matter the measure of either of these two factors, the
home remained at a constant temperature. We did, however, confirm a tight negative correlation
between the fuel consumption and the outside temperature. Higher fuel consumption
correlated to lower outside temperatures."

"Is this true?", you ask. Shocked at the findings.

"It is your highness", they reply with pride.

And then in a faster tempo, excited to tell you the rest of the story, they continue,
"We thought it odd at first. These variables are not logically correlated. But when
we stepped back and took a look at the whole system, we realized what was happening."

"You recall when I mentioned the fuel and how it is extracted from the ground?"
They ask but do not wait for an answer and instead continue on.
"We arrived in late summer, observed that after they started to draw fuel from the ground in late summer,
the temperatures started to drop. And the more fuel they drew, the colder it got.
Eventually, it got so cold, their equipment wouldn't work and they could no longer
draw fuel from the ground. Sure enough, within a matter of days, temperatures
started to rise again."

"Realizing that it is the draw of fuel from the ground that lowers the surface
temperature, which makes the frost, which lowers the air temperature, which
causes the Winter, we had to stop them from drawing any more fuel. But we were
unable to convince them, your highness. Despite all of our data and the obvious
connections. Despite our years of scientific study and mastery, they refused
to accept our findings and insisted on continuing their dangerous practices."

"If we want Winter to end, we must stop them from drawing any more fuel. We must wage war!"

### The lessons of Friedman's Thermostat
There are numerous lessons one could draw from this tale, but we are focused on
two.

#### Correlation is not Causation
The first is best expressed through a common phrase, "Correlation is not Causation."
Observing a correlation between two items doesn't necessarily inform us which
caused the other, if they've such a relationship at all.

In our story, the chief scientist concludes that the draw of fuel from the
ground is causing dropping temperatures. But we know, of course, that the
knowledge of an impending increase in demand due to lowering temperatures is
what causes the extraction of more fuel.

In other cases, it may be that there is no cause/effect relationship at all and
the correlation may be purely coincidental. Take, for example, the per capita
consumption of beef in the US from 2000 through 2009 and the number of deaths
by lightning during that same time period.
The two are clearly positively correlated. This in no way suggests that either
caused the other. This is a coincidental correlation and any conclusions drawn
therefrom are dubious.

#### No Correlation doesn't imply there's No Causation
The second lesson, and the purpose of Friedman's original thermostat metaphor was
to emphasize that there are cases under which, without a comprehensive understanding
of the system, one might conclude through measurement that correlations do not
exist when they do in fact exist. This misread of the system can further lead us to
completely overlook present cause and effect.

In our story, the constant temperature in the house indicated there was no
correlation between the outside temperature and that of the home. Nor was there
a correlation between the fuel consumed and the temperature of the home. This
conclusion was supported by the measurements, but only in as much as the scientists
did not understand the entire system. The furnace (in partnership with the thermostat)
kept the internal temperature regulated such that the actual cause and effect and
the actual correlation between the internal and external temperature, were
indiscernible.

In Friedman's case, the Federal Reserve had long operated under Keynesian
Economic theory and ignored the impact of volume on price stability. Keynesian
theories were developed at a time when measurements indicated no correlation
between volume and price. The formulas developed at the time were, naive,
but worked so long as the system stayed in a particular balance. Throughout
the 70s, that balance was lost and the correlation and thereby the cause and
effect relationship was revealed.
