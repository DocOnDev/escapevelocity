# Velocity Anti-Patterns

If you've been on an agile team that uses velocity as a key metric, you've
probably experienced or at least witnessed some pretty strange behavior.

Ask a group of agile coaches about dysfunctions they've seen on teams related
to the use of velocity and you'll get plenty of responses that inspire
head shaking and hand wringing.

That's exactly what we did to come up with the following list. This is by no
means comprehensive, but it is a reasonable representation of the issues that
exist within organizations when it comes to metrics and management.

## Before we get started
I want to be crystal clear here: The Velocity Anti-Patterns listed here are not
necessarily indications from measuring and reporting velocity.
Many are indications of the pervasiveness of poor management.

You see, Velocity itself is not necessarily harmful.
It is a tool and nothing more.
Just as a knife is a tool and nothing more.
It is not until the human element is introduced that the tool becomes potentially dangerous.
Whether deliberate or inadvertent, it is interaction with the tool that introduces risk.
The better fit the tool is for purpose and the more deliberate and informed the individual,
the lower the risk.

So with that in mind, let's take a look at some of the most common Velocity
Anti-Patterns identified by our coaches and practitioners.






### All Estimates are Equal
comparing velocity across teams and asking everyone to get to a “similar” set of numbers

## Plan by Velocity over Value
Divorcing points from value and/or risk.
Focusing on velocity instead of value.


"We can't use points because of the process of having to give effort estimates for funding" PO straight out of PO Training. LoL




"you can not add any points to the backlog once funding is approved"
measure team perf
forecasting neglecting variance
incl partially done work
partially estimated sprints
1) An organization holding multiple unrelated teams (diff domains and stacks) to the same standard of expected velocity per sprint
2) A Dev mgr reading team's old burndowns like tea leaves to tell them what they did wrong rather than interacting with the team
3) A coach telling a new scrum master "his team should have a velocity of 25" wh knowing nothing about the team, org, product
many SM and coaches not groking the proper Velocity Calculus
choosing between stories based on what fits within sprint rather than what's most important
having a team commit to a velocity number very early in a project (e.g. after 1 sprint)
having a long velocity history with documented team changes but never using it to forecast outcomes, giving made-up dates anyway.
point currency inflation on longer projects. Team member changes without expectation of velocity loss. Small sizing for deadline
Story points are assigned by the Product Owner.
Velocity-centric agile teams that eventually forget customer value and grow technical debt
playing story-point tetris to "fill" the sprint, throwing priorities out of the window
points as effort instead of complexity

Equating it with performance and setting a target: "You need to deliver 70 points this sprint."


Debating far too long about whether a story is 3 or 5 points.

Estimating components of a story (like development and test) and adding the two together. "It's a 5 to develop and a 2 to test, so it's a 7."


Seeing an "ideal" line on a burn-up/down chart annotated with the proper velocity.

fellow who was fond of reminding everyone within his domain he was entitled "Director of Engineering Practices and Services" explained to me "In agile a manager's job is to know his team's velocity and to make it go up."

> mgmt not understanding purpose of Velocity empirical measure;
> teams using some bogus statistical manipulation called an average without the understanding of the constrains that an average is valid within;
> SM allowing teams to carry over stories and get credit for multiple sprints within one measurement (lack of understanding of empirical);
> pressure to give "credit" for effort but zero results - culture dynamic viscous feedback loop;
> lack of understanding of the virtuous cycle that can be built with empirical measurement and understanding of trends;
> no action to embrace the virtuous benefits of a measure-respond-adapt model (specifically story slicing to appropriate size)

> breaking the basic tenants of the scrum estimation model - allow me to expand for those who have already condemned me for violating written (or suggesting unwritten) dogma...
a PBL item has a "size" before being Ready (a gate action) for planning;
the team adjusts the PBL item size any/ever time they touch the item and learn more about it (like at planning/grooming);
each item is sized based on effort/etc. from NOW (or start of sprint - a point in time) to DONE (never on past sunk cost effort);
empirical evidence and updated estimates are a good way to plan;

therefore carryover stories are resized before being brought into the next sprint - also reprioritized - and crying over spilt milk or lost effort credit is not allowed in baseball (or sprint planning)

The team wanting definition of done to be "code complete" instead of "deployed" so the burn down charts would look less depressing. Also, using burndown charts without actually having a strong sprint commitment from the team.
