## Goodhart's Law

Charles Goodhart is an economist and former advisor to the Bank of England.
In 1975, Goodhart delivered two papers to a conference at the Reserve Bank of Australia.
In those papers, Goodhart was discussing research and theory related to monetary
policy and control in the United Kingdom.
In the years leading up to 1975, existing monetary targets and the controls used to
achieve the goals were no longer producing the results desired or expected.
There had been what most considered to be evidence of a stable money demand in the United Kingdom.
It was believed that the growth of money could be controlled through the setting of
short-term interest rates.
Higher interest rates correlated with lower money growth.

Goodhart warned, however, that policies and practices based on specific targets
were flawed.
Goodhart stated,

A common paraphrasing is, "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
When I talk about this, I tend to add, "And the target therefore no longer means what you think it does."
