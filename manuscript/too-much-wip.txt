## Too Much Work In Process

This is a remarkably common issue.
In my experience, management often encourages this behavior.
I don't know if it is the notion that we will get more done if we work on more
things simultaneously.
Or perhaps there is a fear we won't get enough things done unless we work on
several of them at once.

But what happens when we try to work on a few stories each?
Remarkably, we make progress on several, but complete precious few.
The more work in flow, the more context switching we all need to make.
Coordination of the stories complicates testing and migrations.
We look busy, but at the end of the iteration, we've fewer things complete.
Then, at the beginning of the next iteration, a glut of work moves to done,
setting us up with a couple day delay wrapping up the prior iteration and
pushing us into yet another complicated cycle.

Drive each card to completion before picking up the next one.
If a card is blocked, make getting it un-blocked a priority rather than letting
it wait three days because George on the DBA team has a three-day SLA.
